build instructions
---

~~~
git clone https://github.com/zamfofex/jxl-crx
cd jxl-crx
scripts/build.sh
~~~

This will download and build dependencies and create `jxl-mv2.zip` and `jxl-mv3.zip` output files in this repository’s directory.

Note for [Guix] users: You may prefer to use `scripts/guix-build.sh` instead, which will set up a FHS container with the necessary package dependencies for you. However, note that binaries will still be downloaded, so the container has network access.
